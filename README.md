# Predictive Life expectancy in different countries using machine learning-


This project aims to predict life expectancy in different countries using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a variety of socio-economic, health, and environmental factors, the model uncovers insights and correlations that influence life expectancy globally. The project uses a diverse set of datasets, including:

Socioeconomic indicators: Gross national income, human development index, and expenditure percentages.
Health metrics: Adult and infant mortality rates, prevalence of diseases like Hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS, and vaccination coverage.
Environmental factors: CO2 emissions and related climate data.
Demographic data: Gender-specific life expectancy and age-related trends.
The notebook includes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Machine learning models are then trained and evaluated to predict life expectancy with high accuracy, providing actionable insights for policy makers, researchers, and public health officials.

Key features of the project:

Multi-dataset integration for a comprehensive view of factors affecting life expectancy.
Detailed EDA to visualize trends and relationships.
Scalable machine learning pipeline for predictions.
Insights into how socio-economic and health indicators influence life expectancy worldwide.
This repository is ideal for data scientists, public health experts, and anyone interested in leveraging data to solve real-world problems.
